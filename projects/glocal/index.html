<p>The key idea underlying <strong><span class="caps">GLOCAL</span></strong> is to use <strong>events as the primary means to organize and index media</strong>, e.g., photos, videos, news. Instead of starting from media and seeing <strong>a posteriori</strong> how to describe their contents, we organize <strong>a priori</strong> our data and knowledge in terms of <strong>events</strong> and use media to populate them, thus providing their experiential dimension. <strong>Events provide the common framework inside which the local experience-driven contextual information can not only be coded, but also shared and unified. Events have a local and a global dimension</strong>. The former allows mapping tags (conceptualizations) to media (personal experiences), while the latter allows sharing event descriptions (thus enabling social sharing and networking of events, tags and media) but also event structures across similar events, thus providing a common way to index media (social sharing and networking of event structures). In turn, the networking of events and event structures enables the creation of networked communities inside which common (global) descriptions of the world can be built and continuously enriched by the continuous flow of individual (local) descriptions.</p>
