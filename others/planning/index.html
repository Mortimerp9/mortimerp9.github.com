<p>This is an implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphplan">GraphPlan</a> AI planner that can be called from Java. It is implemented in Java and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> with all the planning code being implemented in <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/"><span class="caps">SWI</span>-Prolog</a>.</p>
<p>The domain of the planning can be fully described in Prolog clauses and thus the planning can work on generic rules that will be extended by the theorem prover at the time of the planning.</p>
<p>The planner can however be easily called from Java through a clean <span class="caps">API</span> hiding the Prolog complexity.</p>
<p>The prolog code is already available on github, if you need the java libraries, please contact me.</p>
