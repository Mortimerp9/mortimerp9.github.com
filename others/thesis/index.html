<p>This is my Ph.D. thesis that I finished at the <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/">University of York</a> in 2008 on Human Computer Dialogue and Persuasion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> The research reported in this thesis aims at developing techniques for achieving<br />
 persuasive dialogue between a human user and the computer; in particular,<br />
 it focuses on the formalisation of argumentation for dialogue planning in combination<br />
 with a novel framework for dialogue management to improve both the<br />
reactivity of the dialogue system and its persuasiveness.</p>
<p>
The main hypothesis of this thesis is that a persuasive dialogue requires specific
techniques that cannot be implemented in a purely task-oriented system. In
particular, Persuasive Communication requires to build social bonds, trust and
involvement through social cues, as well as tailored reactions to the user’s arguments
which are difficult to plan a priori. The work presented goes towards
finding novel techniques for dialogue management that offer the reactivity and
flexibility needed for persuasion.
</p>
<p>
In the designed dialogue framework, a layered management system that takes
advantage of state-of-the-art dialogue management approaches is developed. A
planning component tailored to reason about persuasion searches the ideal path
in an argumentation model to persuade the user. To give a reactive and natural
feel to the dialogue, a reactive component extends this task-oriented layer, using
online activation techniques to select dialogue strategies that are difficult to plan
a priori.
<p>
The use of planning guarantees the achievement of persuasive goals and the
consistency of the dialoguewhereas the reactive component is able to better adapt
to the user reactions and show more flexibility, allowing a better perception of
the system by the user.
</p>
<p>
An evaluation protocol is proposed, providing a simple and independent metric
for the persuasiveness of the dialogue system. The evaluation shows that
the novel layered dialogue management framework – the <span class="caps">EDEN</span> Framework –
achieves a measured persuasiveness better than a purely task-oriented system as
the novel approach is able to react more smoothly to the user’s interaction. In
the final evaluation, the Personage (Mairesse &amp; Walker 2007) generator is used
to display different personalities to the user during the persuasive dialogue. Experiments
with the latter approach show the impact of personality simulation
on the user’s perception of the interaction and show the influence of the system
displayed personality on the overall persuasiveness.
