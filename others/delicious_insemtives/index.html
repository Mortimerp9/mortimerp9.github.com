<p>The <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~knowdive/dataset/delicious/">tags2con</a> dataset has been manually created by a group of human annotators that linked <a href="http://www.delicious.com">del.icio.us</a> tags to their real meaning.</p>
<p>A subset of a <a href="http://www.delicious.com">del.icio.us</a> dump has been used to create the tags2con dataset, a set of 500 user-bookmarks pairs have been selected randomly and all the tags used by these pairs have been manually cleaned and disambiguated to WordNet synsets.</p>
<p>Each tag has been split into lemmatized tokens and each of them has then been linked to its meaning in the WordNet 3.0 ontology.</p>
<p>We provide an <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~knowdive/dataset/delicious/tags2con_dataset"><span class="caps">RDF</span> linked dataset</a> of the results of this annotation effort available as dereferenceable resources.</p>
<p>This work has been partly supported by the <a href="http://www.insemtives.eu"><span class="caps">INSEMTIVES</span></a> project (FP7-231181).</p>
